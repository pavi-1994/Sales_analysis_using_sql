-- Task: What would be the output for inner join, left join, right join, and full outer join between these tables?

For inner join  it will return 1,2,3,4,5
For left join it will return 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 19 (it will return null if there is no matching ids in the right table  )
For right join 1,2,3,4,5
From full outer join 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,19 (it will return null if there is no matching ids in the table  )



For inner join  it will  return 1,2,3,4,5
For left join it will return 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 19 (it will return null if there is no matching ids in the right table  )
For right join 1,2,3,4,5
From full outer join 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,19 (it will return null if there is no matching ids in the table  )
